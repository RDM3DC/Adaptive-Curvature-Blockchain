# Adaptive Curvature Coin (ACC)

Adaptive Curvature Coin introduces a Proof-of-Optimization (PoO) consensus, leveraging adaptive curvature dynamics and Adaptive Resistance Principle (ARP) to achieve efficiency, security, and sustainability.

## Project Goals
- Implement Proof-of-Optimization (PoO)
- Demonstrate adaptive curvature dynamics
- Build a decentralized cryptocurrency ecosystem

## Technology Stack
- Python for core consensus mechanism
- Blockchain structure using Flask or FastAPI for simplicity
- Initial development and simulation environment provided
